== Change Log ==

2.1.3 - Removed annoying __MACOSX directory

2.1.2 - Changed font sizes to consistently use em's instead of a mixture of em's and px. Improved search results layout.

2.1.1 - Improved support for HTML5 elements in older browsers, stops IE7 derping because it doesn't understand the tags.

2.1 - Added support for WordPress Custom Background functions allowing users to customise background colour / images and converted some solid colours used on borders etc to rgba to better work on coloured background. Need to suss out how to get foreground colours looking better if for instance, the user sets their background as black.

2.0 - Bug fix for users of lightbox plugins
